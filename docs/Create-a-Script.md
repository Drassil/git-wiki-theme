# Script vs module

On AzerothCore, we don't really use the usual scripts like in other emulators. Instead, we work with modules which are way more practical to use. See Create-a-Module


# Scripts

You still want to make a simple script before switching to modules? Read below.


## How to learn

If you never made any script before, you can study some of the **[modules' scripts](http://www.azerothcore.org/modules-catalogue/)**, compare, dissect etc... If you find some open issues, fix them to improve your skills!


## How to create a script from scratch

You can use this as a base: https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-boilerplates


## How to add your custom script to AzerothCore

For your script to be compiled, read the README.md **[here](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/blob/master/src/server/scripts/Custom/README.md)**
