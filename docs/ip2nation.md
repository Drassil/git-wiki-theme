[<-Back-to:Auth](database-auth.md)

**The \`ip2nation\` and \`ip2nationCountries\` tables**

These tables allow to see approximately which country a player might be from when doing **.pinfo &lt;player&gt;** command.

They are not mantained by TrinityCore development team and **they require external data to perform their function**, which can be found at <http://www.ip2nation.com/ip2nation/Download>

NOTE IF YOU EXPORT THIS DATABASE FROM WINDOWS ENVIROMENT AND IMPORT IT ON LINUX YOU WILL HAVE STARTUP ERROR BECAUSE  **ip2nationCountries** WILL BE RENAMED TO  **ip2nationcountries** IMPORT IT AGAIN FROM IP2NATION WEBPAGE TO FIX IT.
