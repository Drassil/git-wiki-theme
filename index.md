# Welcome to git-wiki demo

This is a [demo](wiki/Demo.md) of git-wiki theme for jekyll.

it's a full featured wiki powered by git, github pages and pull-requests!

It means: 

* Improvements in the cooperative aspect: forks, pull-requests and roles.
* You can customize your wiki as you want with style sheets and even changing the layout.
* No databases! Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.
* Markdown and html mixed together!
* History, revision comparison and everything you need from a wiki platform.
* You can edit your pages with the standard git editor, prose.io (integrated) or any kind of editor you prefer.

You can fork/copy the master branch now and start your wiki in just 1 minute.

Then [share your wiki with us!](wiki/Showreel.md) please.

**Note:**
You can even include the github wiki as a submodule and enable the conf, but it's an experimental feature and it implies less advantages and greater disadvantages for now.

## Installation instructions

1. Fork or copy [this repository](https://github.com/drassil/git-wiki)

2. copy and rename _config.yml.dist in _config.yml changing settings inside

3. create your index.md in root directory

4. push your changes in your repository, then configure the github pages in your repository settings
