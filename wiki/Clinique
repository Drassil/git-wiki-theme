### About Clinique Team

The Clinique app is developed and designed by a team consisting of 3 computer engineers: Amr Monzir, Khaled Shurrab, Hazem Dawoud. Our aim in developing this app is to fill a gap we noticed in the day to day work routine in clinics, as doctors and secretaries spend a great amount of time arranging paperwork tailored to each patient. Clinique is an app that aims to make a cinch out of this tiresome process.

### About Clinique
With Clinique, a doctor will be able to store his patients' information along with their medical history and track the patients' progress through the recovery process, with easy storage and viewing of each medical visit of the patient (session).
Clinique goes a step further to make the process of acquiring a medical history of each patient easier, if a patient has already been treated in any clinic signed into thi app, and with the patient's approval, his medical history can be stored securely and shared with other clinics using the app.
To verify that the signed up clinics are actual clinics, we have an accompanying application we administer to verify the signed up accounts' information before they can use the application.

## Technical
We developed this app using many development tools such as Android Studio, Gimp, Firebase, Visual Studio, Adobe XD. We started out the journey with Android, but we plan to expand the application to work with iOS and be accessable through web as well, as that way it would be the most convenient to use.
- We used Android Studio to develop the Android application with all its components.
- We used Gimp to create promotional photos.
- We used Firebase to store the data of the application's users.
- We used Visual Studio to create the accompanying application that verifies signing up clincs.
- We used Adobe XD to create the app design.
