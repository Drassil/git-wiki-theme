## Installation Guidelines

Use the flutter run command to run your Flutter app on a connected device or simulator.

To run your app from the command-line:

Open a terminal and change directories to the root of your app (the same directory that contains the pubspec.yaml file for your project).

Run the following command. Once the flutter tool is running, if you change the app’s source code, you can hit r to hot-reload your application (updating the source on the fly without actually restarting the entire app).

`$ cd myapp`
`$ flutter run`

If more than one device is connected, use the flutter devices command to get their IDs, and then `flutter run -d deviceID` to run your app.
